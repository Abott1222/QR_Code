%% Course: Digital Image and Video Processig --- University of Maryland College Park ---- Spring 2015%%%%%%%%%%%%

This project could not have been performed without the assistance and guidance of several
individuals. First and foremost, I would like to thank our course instructor,
Professor Min Wu for her valuable advises. 

I also wanted to appreciate the assistance of the course co-instructor Mr. Chau-Wai WONG(Future Faculty Member) for 
his useful directions.

I would also like to also thank Mr. Rouzbeh A. Shirvani for helping me through the basic concepts
in pattern recognition part which was very important to continue the procedure.

It is necessary to mention that the pattern recognition part is inspired from the other
QR-Code project on Github by Teodor Vik, Oscar Westberg, Mikael Zackrisson and 
Anton Österblad.
